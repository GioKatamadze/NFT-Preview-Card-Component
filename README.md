## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Create card wrapper div
3. Add images and text
4. Give images sizes and styles in CSS
5. Give texts and icons font styles in CSS
6. Create hover effects for an image, title and author

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using hover feature in CSS, the main challenge that I overcame was blue eye overlay effect on image hover. After 1-2 hours of research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the CSS code, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master hover, transition and animation using CSS to make more dynamic and interactive projects
